Project: Assignment_3_Webpage
This project was completed for Information Technology Fundamentals SP2 2022

During the course of this project I was asked to create a webpage on a topic that I had previously written about,
The topic was an unimportant part of the project but it helped to give the page a nice layout. 

my motivation behind this project was to further my learning in both html and javascript, both of these topics are very important in todays environment as a major portion of the internet relies on both of these, it is a passion of mine to be able to work in the industry, this motivation allowed me to be interested in what i was learning and simultaneosly motivated at the same time.

The project does not really solve any problems, it was more of a project to learn from and allow my knowledge to expand on the topics at hand.

To use the website, i believe all parts of the of the assignment_3 folder on github must be downloaded, and then the url must be pasted into the urlbar at the top of any browser/explorer.

The real assessable parts of the assignment of the project included, storing data, using buttons to opens images, and changing the theme of the website with a button.

The data storage area of the assignment is used to store 2 pieces of data, both the username of the person and the theme allocated to that persons name.

The storing data section of the webpage was difficult as it would not work in the way i intended, the theme data storage worked for me, but the user_name would not work for me, it would always clear the user_name as soon as it was submitted and i could not find a way despite spending many hours to work around it. it also wouldn't allow for text to be changed after something was submitted. it would only change for 1ms then change back which also could not be fixed no matter what i tried. I tried a lot of different things but just couldn't seem to get it to work the way it was intended to. I did eventually get it working as i discovered that the problem was having 2 onload commands in the body section, i am still unsure why it was causing that issue as it should have only been changing colours and not text but it was fixed nonetheless




The buttons function is meant to open a picture that was given to us through the assignment specifications sheet, 5 different buttons are programmed to open 5 different images and also the photogrpahers name.

Using buttons to open images was a slighly easier task to undertake, i was required to learn a few new things like changing text context onclick and changing the source of the image on button click, although it wasnt as difficult as the data section of the task, it was still a good learning topic and provided helped to smooth over some of the things i had learned during the practicals




The changing of the theme section of the assignment aims to let the user change between the light and dark modes of the page, it uses 2 color pallets and applies them according to what the user selects. To change the color theme, all the user is required to do is click the toggle theme button

during the creation of the dark theme, i was unsuccessful in using data=theme=dark, I was unable to find a way to properly implement it, due to my lack of knowledge and lack of online resources to help me. i opted to use a different method in which i was previously accustomed to using. this methods although not "correct" still implements the dark color palette and applies it accordingly for the same results as what data=theme would do, therefore I do believe although it's only 90% correct it was still useful to learn.

Summed up the assignment was a good learning assignment as it allowed me to start a website from scratch and learn how different elements and parts of html interact with both css and javascript, although at times I did feel underprepared for some parts of the assignments as the classes different delve that deeply into some topics i was still able to do some research and persevere.
