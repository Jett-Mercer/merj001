Project: Assignment_3_Webpage
This project was completed for INFT SP2

During the course of this project I was asked to create a webpage on a topic that I had previously written about,
The topic was an unimportant part of the project but it helped to give the page a nice layout. 

The real assessable parts of the assignment of the project included, storing data, using buttons to opens images, and changing the theme of the website with a button.

The storing data section of the webpage was difficult as it would not work in the way i intended, the theme data storage worked for me, but the user_name would not work for me, it would always clear the user_name as soon as it was submitted and i could not find a way despite spending many hours to work around it. it also wouldn't allow for text to be changed after something was submitted. it would only change for 1ms then change back which also could not be fixed no matter what i tried. I tried a lot of different things but just couldn't seem to get it to work the way it was intended to.

Using buttons to open images was a slighly easier task to undertake, i was required to learn a few new things like changing text context onclick and changing the source of the image on button click, although it wasnt as difficult as the data section of the task, it was still a good learning topic
