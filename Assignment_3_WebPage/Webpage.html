        <h2>What Are Fifth Generation Programming Languages?</h2>
        <p>
          Fifth Generation Programming Languages are the highest current level
          of programming languages, they look to try and bridge the gap between native
          languages (e.g english) and programming languages.
        </p>
        <h3>Different 5GL Languages</h3>

        <p>
          With any level of programming languages there and many different individual programming languages,
          this is also the case with Fifth generation languages, although there are significantly less options.
          To name the most well known 5GL's there is: Mercury, Lisp and Prolog. These three languages are the most well know
          and highly regarded fifth generation languages. Most of these languages in their current forms are not very usable or accessible to the public and 
          have also ceased development as problems started to occur.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>How do they work?</h3>
        <p>
          Fifth Generation Programming Languages allow a user to input a problem and then it solves it using artificial intelligence,
          the computer will break down the individual components of the problem and use pre-determined blocks of code and 
          also previously used code that best suits the problem at hand. This way of solving the problems become problematic when the problem is of any substantial size as there are too many variables 
          for it to account for.
        </p>
        <h3>How close are we?</h3>
        <p>
          How close are we is a hard question to answer, similarly to asking how long a piece of string is. The answer is we are not really sure, many of 
          the previous research and develop into the topic revealed that it was just too difficult to cover every single outcome and problem that may be implemented
          the amount of dedicated resources needed to be able to solve any problem given to it is too much for our current technology. There are however developments that are parallel to 
          fifth generation languages, in the form of low-code languages and no-code languages. Both of these languages look to remove the knowledge needed to program and allows anyone with a 
          problem to try and come up with a solution despite having 0 previous knowledge with coding
